<p> Hi there! I am a computer science major at Tufts University.
    Some of my interests include playing drums and guitar, composing and produce music,
    coding with friends, and eating food. I am the drummer for
    Tufts-University based love-punk band "Indian Twin", and am working on my own self produced material to be released some time in the near future.
